# AgroBased Africa

## Empowering African agriculture through blockchain-based asset tokenization and investment

AgroBased is a revolutionary platform that leverages blockchain technology to address critical challenges in African agriculture. By tokenizing agricultural assets, we aim to bridge the gap between African farmers and global investors, unlocking the vast potential of the continent's agricultural sector.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/agrobased.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=""
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT=""
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_GATEWAY=""
   ```

## Running the Project Locally

1. Start the local development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing

To run the test suite:

1. Make sure you're in the project root directory

2. Run the test command:
   ```
   npm test
   ```

This will run both the React component tests and the smart contract tests.

To run smart contract tests specifically:

```
npx hardhat test
```

To run a local blockchain for testing:

1. In a separate terminal, start a local Hardhat node:
   ```
   npx hardhat node
   ```

2. Deploy your contracts to the local network:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

3. Update your `.env` file with the local contract address
